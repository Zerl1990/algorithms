# What is an algorithm?
* Informally an algorithm is any well-defined computational procedure that takes some value, or set of values, as **input** and produces some value, or set of values, as **output**.
* In other words and algorithm is a sequence of computational steps that transform the **input** into the **output**.
* We can also view an algorithm as a tool for solving a well-defined computational problem. In general, an **instance** of a problem consists of the **input** needed to compute a solution to the problem.
* An algorithm is said to be **correct** if, for every **input instance**, it halts with the **correct output**. We say that a **correct** algorithm solves the given computational problem.
* Contrary to what you might expect, **incorrect** algorithms can sometimes be useful, if we can control their **error rate**.
* Different algorithms devised to solve the same problem often differ dramaticallyt in their **effiency (Time|Memory)**. These differences can be much more significant than diferences due to hardware and software

# What is a data Structures?
* A data structure is a way to **store and organize data** in order to facilitate acccess and modifications.
* No single data structure works well for all purpose, and so it is important to know the strenghts and limitations of several of them


# Algorithms and other technologies
* Algorithms are truly important on contemporary computers, technologies examples:
** Advance computer architectures and fabrication technlogies
  * Easy to use, intuitive, graphical user interface (GUIs)
  * Object oriented systems
  * Integrated Web technologies
  * Fast Networking, both wired and wireless
