# What is an algorithm?
* Informally an algorithm is any well-defined computational procedure that takes some value, or set of values, as **input** and produces some value, or set of values, as **output**.
* In other words and algorithm is a sequence of computational steps that transform the **input** into the **output**.
* We can also view an algorithm as a tool for solving a well-defined computational problem. In general, an **instance** of a problem consists of the **input** needed to compute a solution to the problem.
* An algorithm is said to be **correct** if, for every **input instance**, it halts with the **correct output**. We say that a **correct** algorithm solves the given computational problem.
* Contrary to what you might expect, **incorrect** algorithms can sometimes be useful, if we can control their **error rate**.
* Different algorithms devised to solve the same problem often differ dramaticallyt in their **effiency (Time|Memory)**. These differences can be much more significant than diferences due to hardware and software

# What is a data Structures?
* A data structure is a way to **store and organize data** in order to facilitate acccess and modifications.
* No single data structure works well for all purpose, and so it is important to know the strenghts and limitations of several of them


# Algorithms and other technologies
* Algorithms are truly important on contemporary computers, technologies examples:
** Advance computer architectures and fabrication technlogies
  * Easy to use, intuitive, graphical user interface (GUIs)
  * Object oriented systems
  * Integrated Web technologies
  * Fast Networking, both wired and wireless


# Problem
## Comparison of runtimes
For each function *f(n)* and time *t* in the following table, determine the largest size *n* for a problem that can be solved in time *t*, assuming that the algorithm to solve the problem takes *f(n)* microseconds

**Values to calculate the time:**
1. 1 second  = 10<sup>6</sup> *us*
2. 1 min     = 6 x 10<sup>7</sup> *us*
3. 1 hour    = 36 x 10<sup>8</sup> *us*
4. 1 day     = 864 x 10<sup>8</sup> *us*
5. 1 month   = 2.5 x 10<sup>12</sup> *us* 
6. 1 year    = 3.1 x 10<sup>13</sup> *us* 
7. 1 century = 3.1 x 10<sup>16</sup> *us*
